        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>In an attempt to describe who I am today, given the context of my early life experiences, I would say I am highley independant and drawn to activities that require a certain level of initiatve and self reliance. I look for a lot of autonomy in my career choice, both in income and effort which are often directly linked. I appreciate the example that was set for me by a hard working mother as a child and know inherently that there is no substitute for effort. I enjoy competative sports and the comradarie it creates as it reminds me of my time in the service. Hockey is my game of choice and you will not find a bigger Anahiem Ducks Fan. I enjoy the outdoors and challanging hikes or backpacking trips. I am a fiercly loyal friend and family advocate. I believe the strong have a duty to stand up for those who cannot stand themselves. While my approach to life may continue to evolve and change, this is the bedrock of who I am. Thank you for reading!</p>
